# Prediction of Monkeypox disease using Machine Learning Techniques
* In this study, we have explored the application of various machine learning techniques to predict MonkeyPox disease. 

-> Specifically, we evaluated eight different techniques which includes 
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- KNN 
- SVM 
- Ada Boosting 
- Gradient Boosting

-> We found that SVM and Gradient Boosting consistently outperformed the other methods in terms of accuracy and F1 score. 

- Our results demonstrate the potential of machine learning approaches for predicting MonkeyPox disease
    * and suggest that SVM and Gradient Boosting may be particularly effective methods for this task.
    * However, we also acknowledge that there may be limitations and potential sources of bias in our approach, such as the quality and representativeness of our data.

- Moving forward, we believe that further research is needed to refine and validate our approach as well as to explore alternative machine learning algorithms and data sources.
     * Nevertheless, our findings have important implications for understanding and addressing the MonkeyPox disease and may ultimately contribute to more effective predictions.
